# CZ2001 Group 4 Project 2 Code Submission 
  
## Prerequisites: 
- Java8 and maven 
  
## Running the program: 
- mvn compile 
- mvn install 
- mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=cz2001.Main 
  
Instructions to run the algorithms are provided in the command line interface. 
  
--- For visualisation --- 
To run a visualisation with randomly generated test sets, the number of edges provided has to be 25 or less. This is a self imposed restriction as we feel that the visualisation tool would be too cluttered and messy with too many nodes, defeating its purpose. An image would be generated for each node, such that every node has the chance to be a starting node. For the first h images, it would not have any path since the node itself is a hospital node. Starting node performing BFS would be marked as a green node, red nodes are the hospital nodes and brown nodes are the identified shortest path.
