## CZ2001 Group 4 Project 1 Code Submission 

  
### Prerequisites:
  
1. Any latest of JRE to run java programs 
2. .fna files that you wish to test on has to be placed in the same working directory as SearchGenome.class 
  
### Instructions to run the program:
  
1. if SearchGenome.class is not present, compile SearchGenome.java using the command: javac SearchGenome.java 
2. Run SearchGenome.class with the command: java SearchGenome 
  
### Program Constraints:
  
1. Size of .fna files that might be readable varies according to the hardware specs, in cases of crashes like 
a memory error, it indicates not an error in the program but a limitation posed by the hardware. For reference,
we have tested up to 3GB .fna files on a laptop with 32GB RAM. 
  
2. As documented in the report, pattern sizes longer than 32 characters will not be accepted as an input pattern 
for our implementation of hash search.
